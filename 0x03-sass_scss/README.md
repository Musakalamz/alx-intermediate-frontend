# 📌 ProDev Frontend – SASS/SCSS for Efficient Styling

---

## 📖 Overview

This project introduces **SASS/SCSS**, a CSS preprocessor that improves styling workflows with **variables, nesting, and mixins**. By completing the tasks, you’ll gain hands-on experience writing maintainable and efficient stylesheets used in real-world development.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Install and configure the SASS compiler.
- Compile `.scss` files into standard `.css`.
- Use **variables** to store reusable values.
- Apply **nesting** to structure styles.
- Write **mixins** for reusable style patterns.

---

## 🛠 Key Concepts

- **Variables (`$variable`)** – store values like colors, fonts, or sizes.
- **Nesting** – structure CSS selectors hierarchically.
- **Mixins (`@mixin / @include`)** – reusable blocks of styles with optional arguments.

---

## 📦 Tools Used

- Node.js v20.16.0
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- nvm (Node Version Manager)
- SASS Compiler v3.7.4

---

## 🚀 Real-World Use Cases

- **Design systems** with reusable variables.
- **Modular CSS architecture** using nesting and partials.
- **Rapid development** with mixins for responsive layouts or vendor prefixes.
- **Maintainability** by changing one variable instead of hundreds of repeated values.
